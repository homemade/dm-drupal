== DM Drupal ==

Its a Datamapper wrapper for a drupal+cck database.

lots of eval right now. sorry.

== Install ==

to install:
  
  gem install dm-drupal

  
== Using Hooks ==

this is for associating with dynamic cck fields that don't exist when the app loads.

class BlogPost
  include DataMapper::Resource  
  post_drupal do
    has 1, :drupal_blog_post,
      :repository => repository(:drupal),
      :class_name => 'Drupal::BlogPost',
      :child_key => ['legacy_blog_post_id']
  end
end
